<h1>Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations</h1>
<p>This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:</p>
<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>markdown
![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>will generate a <code>.html</code> page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate an <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked to.</p>
<p>For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything. The script has two dependencies that can be installed with</p>
<p><code>bash
pip install click markdown</code></p>

<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>not applicable </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Tobias Brock: 12651637, Anne Gritto: 11946974, Stefanie Schwarz: 12662420 </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We used the third-party framework PyTorch, specifically leveraging Torch Lightning, in our project. We used functionality from PyTorch for defining and training neural network models, taking advantage of its flexible and efficient tensor operations. Torch Lightning provided a higher-level interface that simplified the process of training and validating our models, managing the boilerplate code and improving the reproducibility of our experiments.</p>
<p>The automatic handling of training loops, validation checks, and logging within Torch Lightning significantly accelerated our development process. We also utilized its built-in support for multi-GPU training and checkpointing, which ensured efficient use of computational resources and easy recovery of model states. Overall, using PyTorch and Torch Lightning allowed us to focus more on the core logic and experimentation aspects of the project, rather than the intricacies of model training, which greatly contributed to the successful completion of our project. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We used anaconda for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was partly auto-generated by pipreqs for packages that are imported explicetly. Other implecitly called dependencies are added manually to the <code>requirements.txt</code> file. This ensured that all necessary packages and their versions were accurately captured for reproducibility.
To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands:</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<p>% Create a new Anaconda environment with Python 3.11:</p>
<p>conda create -n mlops python==3.11</p>
<p>% Activate the newly created environment:</p>
<p>conda activate mlops</p>
<p>% Install all packages from requirements.txt and additional</p>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<p>pip install nvgpu</p>
<p>% Install the project dependencies: </p>
<p>pip install -e .</p>
<p>```</p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em>
Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>From the cookiecutter template cookiecutter-data-science, we filled out most of the provided folders and added a few additional ones for our project's specific needs. Specifically, we included the data, docker, and models folders to handle data storage, source code, and model definitions respectively. However, the references folder was not applicable to our simple model.</p>
<p>Additionally, we chose not to use setup.cfg because flake8 linting is handled by ruff. We also added a config folder to implement Hydra for configuration management, and a tests folder to facilitate unit testing and continuous integration through GitHub Actions. This structure ensures that our project is well-organized and maintains best practices for scalability and collaboration. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these</strong>
<strong>concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>For code formatting we are using ruff. You can automatically format your code pep8 conform with:
<code>ruff format . # formats all files in directory, respectively</code>
<code>pre-commit run --all-files # as ruff linting and ruff formatter are used as precommit hooks</code>
Also every function is required a docstring in our repo.
This matters because of readability and mitigating having minor changes (as new lines at end of the script) during a commit. Having google doc strings in every function allows for facilitated code comprehension and is therefore a best practice. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In total we have implemented 39 tests. We are testing the data part of the project, especially with make_dataset.py and preprocessing.py, and the model related part, which is aiming at the model.py and train_model.py. The other scripts of the module are mainly consisting of the one function, which is highly entangeled with other services like wandb. The testing is more complex here, since this functionality has to be mocked and can't be tested. Additionally, we wrote two test files for integration test of the inference and monitoring app. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The total code coverage of our code is 75%, which includes fakenews\config.py, fakenews\data\make_dataset.py, fakenews\data\preprocessing.py, fakenews\model\model.py, fakenews\model\train_model.py, and all related init and test files. While we strive for higher coverage, achieving 100% coverage is challenging due to the complexity and interactions of advanced functions, many of which are wrapped within other functions, making them difficult to test in isolation.</p>
<p>Even if we were to reach 100% code coverage, it would not necessarily guarantee that the code is error-free. Code coverage metrics indicate how much of the code is executed during testing, but they do not guarantee the absence of logical errors, edge cases, or unforeseen interactions. It is crucial to complement high code coverage with comprehensive testing strategies, including integration tests, system tests, and manual testing, to ensure the robustness and reliability of the software. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We made use of both branches and pull requests (PRs) in our project. Each member of our group created their own branches to work on distinct features, ensuring isolated development environments. From an early stage of the project, every branch was merged into the main branch exclusively through PRs, which were reviewed by another team member. This practice underscored the importance of the "Zwei-Augen-Prinzip" (two-eyes principle), ensuring that code quality was consistently improved through peer reviews.</p>
<p>Although we aimed to include main branch protection rules to enforce this practice through GitHub, our private account did not support this feature. Nonetheless, we implemented continuous integration with unit tests and pre-commit checks as a form of branch protection, ensuring that only thoroughly vetted code was integrated into the main branch. This workflow significantly improved our version control process, maintaining code quality and reducing integration issues. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We did make use of DVC in the following way: Initially, we integrated DVC with Google Drive to store our version-controlled data as hashed files. By doing so, we only needed to push the data.dvc file to GitHub and tag the current data version. Later, we updated our setup to pull/push DVC data to Google Cloud Buckets for better scalability and access workflows.</p>
<p>We decided to version control the entire data folder with DVC to ensure we tracked all changes and avoided any inconsistencies between data files. In the end, DVC helped us manage storage space efficiently by preventing redundant data uploads and downloads. It also enabled us to control and document changes in our dataset continuously. This was particularly beneficial for our pipeline, as it ensured reproducibility and allowed team members to work with consistent and accurate versions of the data across different stages of the project.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,</strong>
<strong>linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free</strong>
<strong>to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing</em>
<em>and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen</em>
<em>here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We have organized our continuous integration (CI) into three separate files: one for code formatting and linting with Ruff, one for running a Docker image on pull requests (PRs), and one for testing. This setup ensures that our codebase remains clean, our data is accurately tested, and our deployment process is streamlined.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Code Formatting and Linting
For code formatting and linting, we use Ruff. This workflow runs on every push and PR to ensure that our code adheres to the style guidelines and is free from common errors. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit Testing and Data Validation
Our unit tests are divided into various components, with a specific focus on the data part. We use a DVC workflow to test the current version of the data associated with the PR. This setup used to require storing Google Drive credentials in GitHub secrets, allowing us to pull the correct data version and run the tests accordingly. Currently, the dvc is connected to a Google Cloud Bucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docker Image Build and Deployment
We have a workflow that triggers on PRs to the main branch. This workflow builds a Docker image for training on Google Cloud Build and saves it at the Artifact Registry. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example Workflow
An example of a triggered workflow can be seen in our "Run test" workflow. This workflow ensures that all rests are con successfully before merging a PR.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example GitHub Actions Workflow: https://github.com/StefanieSwz/fake-news-classification/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yaml</p>

<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We used a simple argparser, configured as follows:</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<p>python fakenews/model/train_model.py --model.dropout_rate=0.2 --train.batch_size=16</p>
<p>% or using Makefile for convenience</p>
<p>make train ARGS=”train.epochs=5 train.lr=0.01”</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Our script is fully automated with make commands, and all configurations are managed by Hydra, with default settings stored in the config folder as YAML files. Additionally, we can modify Hydra configs when running Docker containers locally:</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<p>docker build -f docker/trainer_local.dockerfile . -t trainer:latest</p>
<p>docker run --name <container_name> -v %cd%/models:/models/ trainer:latest train.local_data=True train.local_wandb=True <model.dropout_rate=0.3 train.batch_size=8></p>
<p>```</p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We made use of config files to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments. Whenever an experiment is run, the following steps occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Config Management: Configurations can be changed via command line inputs, and the used configs are automatically stored in the outputs/ folder. Each experiment's folder is named according to the date and time it was run and includes the configs, Hydra settings, and override YAML files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging and Tracking: We save all logged parameters, especially for the best run, using Weights &amp; Biases (wandb). This includes detailed records of the hyperparameters, metrics, and results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docker for Reproducibility: Docker containers are used to ensure that the environment remains consistent across different runs. The Docker files are version-controlled and stored, making it easy to reproduce the exact environment in which the experiments were conducted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To reproduce an experiment, one would simply need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the relevant config files from the outputs/ folder or from wandb logs.</li>
<li>If preferred, use the Docker container to ensure the same environment.</li>
<li>Run the experiment using the stored configurations.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 14 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>For our project, we developed several Docker images: one for training, one for inference, and one for deployment. This approach ensured a consistent environment across different stages of our workflow.</p>
<p>To run the training Docker image locally, we use the following commands: </p>
<p>```bash</p>
<p>docker build -f docker/trainer_local.dockerfile . -t trainer:latest</p>
<p>docker run --name <container_name> -v %cd%/models:/models/ trainer:latest train.local_data=True train.local_wandb=True <model.dropout_rate=0.3 train.batch_size=8></p>
<p>```</p>
<p>This setup mounts the models folder to save the weights locally, allowing us to persist the trained models outside of the container. </p>
<p>For running the training via Google Cloud Run, we have seperate docker files and we do not mount the folder, as these platforms handle storage differently.</p>
<p>By using Docker, we ensured that our experiments were reproducible and could be easily shared with team members or deployed to different environments without compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Link to the trainer Docker file (for cloud usage): https://github.com/StefanieSwz/fake-news-classification/blob/main/trainer.dockerfile </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Debugging methods varied among group members. Some members preferred normal code commenting and debugging through error messages, while others utilized the Python debugger (pdb) through command line and breakpoints for a more interactive approach. These methods helped us identify and resolve issues efficiently.</p>
<p>We also performed basic profiling of our main code to ensure there were no major runtime issues. This profiling revealed that, apart from the expected training time for the neural network, no significant performance bottlenecks were present. The extended training time was primarily due to resource limitations on local laptops and was not indicative of code inefficiencies. Additionally, using PyTorch Lightning, known for its well-structured classes and methods, further assured us of the performance and reliability of our codebase.</p>

<h2>Working in the cloud</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We used the following services:
- <strong>Buckets</strong> in the Cloud Storage with object versioning to store the data and best model weights.
- <strong>Artifact registry</strong> where the docker images are stored and we set up a <strong>Trigger</strong> to use continuous integration, i.e. the Trigger automatically starts the building process of an image each time we push code to the repository.
- <strong>Vertex AI</strong> to train the model on CPUs. With Vertex AI, we can create custom jobs and use the docker containers that have everything to run our code. Although it is also possible to train on a GPU using Vertex AI, we did not get an approval to increase quota.
- <strong>Compute Engine</strong> to train the model on both, CPUs and GPUs. To train with a GPU, we used a Nvidia T4 GPU with a public deep learning image that has Python 3.10 and CUDA 12.1 preinstalled. The training on a CPU uses an <code>e2-standard-4</code> as machine type.
- <strong>Cloud Run</strong> to deploy the model with a frontend and backend application.
- <strong>Secret Manager</strong> to store Weights and Biases API key to make code runnable in the Cloud. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Question 18</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs</strong>
<strong>you used?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the</em>
<em>using a custom container: ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We used the Google Cloud Compute Engine to run our training experiments, utilizing both CPU and GPU virtual machine (VM) instances tailored to our specific needs.</p>
<p>For GPU-based training, we selected an image with Nvidia drivers and PyTorch (c0-deeplearning-common-cu121-v20240627-debian-11-py310). We created a VM with n1-standard-8 machine type and 100GB of storage. Upon starting the VM, we were prompted to install the Nvidia driver by typing y when asked: install nvidia driver?[y/n]. This setup provided us with pre-installed Git, nvidia-smi, and conda, ensuring a smooth environment for our deep learning tasks.</p>
<p>For CPU-based training, we utilized the e2-standard-4 machine type. This instance type offered a balance of performance and cost, suitable for less computationally intensive tasks. All necessary framesworks had to be installed from scretch via terminal, as no specific compute image was selected.</p>
